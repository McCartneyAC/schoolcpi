Abstract

`cpiget` constructs an annual CPI data series based on a user-specified fiscal-year time span. The CPI series is scaled such the monthly period spanned by bstart(yyyy mm) and bend(yyyy mm) is equal to 100. This program uses the import fred command introduced in Stata 15 to download monthly CPI data from the St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank (FRED) data repository.
